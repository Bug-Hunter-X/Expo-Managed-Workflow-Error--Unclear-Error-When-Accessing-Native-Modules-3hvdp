The solution depends on the specific native module you were trying to use. If there's an Expo-compatible alternative, use that. Otherwise, you'll likely need to eject your Expo project to a bare React Native project.  This involves losing some of the convenience of Expo's managed workflow.  Ejecting is a significant step, so consider carefully whether it's necessary.  Here's how you might rewrite the code (replace with actual module):

```javascript
// expoBugSolution.js
import * as ExpoCamera from 'expo-camera'; // Example using Expo's camera API

// ... rest of your component using ExpoCamera ...
```

If an Expo alternative doesn't exist, you'll need to eject and install the native module directly into your project.  The steps to eject vary depending on your Expo SDK version. Refer to Expo's documentation for up-to-date guidance on ejecting.
